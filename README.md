# pyGame Breakout

A classic Breakout/Brick Breaker game implemented in Python using Pygame. Control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy all the bricks on the screen while avoiding letting the ball fall off the bottom.

This project is inspired by the ZX Spectrum game **"Thru' The Wall"**, recreating the classic brick-breaking gameplay with modern Python development practices.
